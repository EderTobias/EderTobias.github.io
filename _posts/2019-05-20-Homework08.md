# Cleaning the "Dispatch":

## 1a:

```
import os      #importing the OS Module 
import re      #importing regular expressions

original_path = "C:\\Users\\Tobias\\Desktop\\UNI\\_MA Geschichte\\Zweites Semester\\KU Digital Humanities\\wgetfolder\\Articles3\\" #defining a variable for the path to the xml-files of the Dispatch

listOfFiles = os.listdir(original_path) #defining a variable for the path to the xml-files, creating a list of files

new_path = "C:\\Users\\Tobias\\Desktop\\UNI\\_MA Geschichte\\Zweites Semester\\KU Digital Humanities\\_Aufgaben\\CleanCopiesText" #defining a variable for the path to the folder we want to save our new file at

for f in listOfFiles: #looping through the files
    with open(original_path+f, "r", encoding="utf8") as f1:     #opening the files
        data = f1.read()    #defining a variable "datat" to read the files of the "Dispatch"
    
    
 
    data = re.sub("<[^<]+>", "", data)          #removing the xml/html-headers (<...>) from each xml-file of the "Dispatch"

   


    newFileName = f + "_modified.xml"           #creating/saving the new files with the same name + adding the string "_modified.xml" 
    with open(new_path+newFileName, "w", encoding="utf8") as f9:
