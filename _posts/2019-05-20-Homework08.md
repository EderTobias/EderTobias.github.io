# Cleaning the "Dispatch":

## 1a:

```
import os
import re      #import regular expressions

original_path = "C:\\Users\\Tobias\\Desktop\\UNI\\_MA Geschichte\\Zweites Semester\\KU Digital Humanities\\wgetfolder\\Articles3\\"

listOfFiles = os.listdir(original_path) #getting all friles from the folder

new_path = "C:\\Users\\Tobias\\Desktop\\UNI\\_MA Geschichte\\Zweites Semester\\KU Digital Humanities\\_Aufgaben\\CleanCopiesText"

for f in listOfFiles: #looping through the files
    with open(original_path+f, "r", encoding="utf8") as f1:     #opening the files
        data = f1.read()
    
    
 
    data = re.sub("<[^<]+>", "", data)          #removing the xml/html-headers (<...>)

   


    newFileName = f + "_modified.xml"           #creating/saving the new files
    with open(new_path+newFileName, "w", encoding="utf8") as f9:
        f9.write(data)
```


## 1b:

```
`import os
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup 

original_path = "C:\\Users\\Tobias\\Desktop\\UNI\\_MA Geschichte\\Zweites Semester\\KU Digital Humanities\\wgetfolder\\Articles3\\"

listOfFiles = os.listdir(original_path) #getting all friles from the folder

new_path = "C:\\Users\\Tobias\\Desktop\\UNI\\_MA Geschichte\\Zweites Semester\\KU Digital Humanities\\_Aufgaben\\CleanCopiesArticles\\"


for f in listOfFiles: #looping through the files
    with open(original_path+f, "r", encoding="utf8") as f1:     #opening the files
        data = BeautifulSoup(f1.read(), 'lxml')

    date = data.find_all("date", limit = 2)[1] #finding the issue-date. first I tried with 'data.find_all("date") which caused an error that I didn't fully understand, which is why I tried Michael Hubers version, which I think is a command to only use one of the variables/values, so I think it should work with [1] and [0] as well
    
    issue_date = date.get("value") #pulling the text associated with the value of the variable 'date', which should be 'xxxx-xx-xx'

    articles = data.find_all("div3", {"type":"article"}) #finding all the articles in the files, which are marked with 'div3 type="article"'
    counter = 0     #setting the counter
    for item in articles: #looping through 'articles'
        counter += 1    #updating the counter
        article = item.get_text() #pulling the text associated with the 'div3 type="articles"'-tag
        newFileName = issue_date + "_" + str(counter) #creating name for the new files
        with open(new_path+newFileName, "w", encoding="utf8") as f9: #creating the new files
            f9.write(article)`
```
