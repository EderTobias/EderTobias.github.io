#Homework 10

## Step 1:

I did make some mistake here (or maybe several), but that's the way I thought it could be done.

```
import os, re

source_folder = "C:\\Users\\Tobias\\Desktop\\UNI\\_MA Geschichte\\Zweites Semester\\KU Digital Humanities\\wgetfolder\\Articles3\\"
target_folder = "C:\\Users\\Tobias\\Desktop\\UNI\\_MA Geschichte\\Zweites Semester\\KU Digital Humanities\\_Aufgaben\\PlaceNames\\"
path_to_geonames = "C:\\Users\\Tobias\\Desktop\\UNI\\_MA Geschichte\\Zweites Semester\\KU Digital Humanities\\_Aufgaben\\PlaceNames\\US\\"

list_of_files = os.listdir(source_folder)


dicFreq = {}
list_of_places = []
resultsCSV = []


for f in list_of_files:     #looping through the files from the 'Dispatch'
    with open(source_folder + f, "r", encoding="utf8") as f1:
        placename = re.findall(r'<placeName reg=".*" key=".*" authname=".*">', f) #finding the placenames
        if "tgn,[0-9]+" in placename:
            reg = re.search(r'reg="[A-Z]+"', f).group(1)    #getting the placenames
            key = re.search(r'key="tgn,[0-9]+"', f).group(1) #getting the tgn

            placename = "%09d\t%s" % (reg, key) #appending placenames and tgn to a variable "placename"

            
        list_of_places.append(placename) #appending the placenames to a list


def places_frequency(list_of_places):   #defining a function to create a dictionary that counts the frequency of the placenames
    placefreq = [list_of_places.count(p) for p in list_of_places]
    return dict(zip(list_of_places, placefreq))


dicfreq = places_frequency #storing the function into a variable

        

for key, value in dicfreq.items():  #creating a csv-file for the frequency of the placenames as described on the course-website
    if value > 1:
        newVal = "%09d\t%s" % (value, key)
        resultsCSV.append(newVal)

resultsCSV = sorted(resultsCSV, reverse=True)
print(len(resultsCSV))
resultsToSave = "\n".join(resultsCSV) 

with open(target_folder+"results.csv", "w", encoding="utf8") as f9: #creating a csv-file for the frequency of the placenames as described on the course-website
    f9.write("\n".join(resultsCSV))

with open(target_folder+"placenames.csv", "w", encoding="utf8") as f9:      #creating csv-file for the placenames
    f9.write("\n".join(list_of_places))
    
```

##Step 2:

Step 2 is were I failed completely, as I couldn't find a solution for getting the relevant date from the Geonames-file

```
python_dictionary1 = {                  #creating the python_dictionary1 where keys are placenames and values 
    (list_of_places, list_of_places
    }

python_dictionary2 = {          #?????? get placename, lat, lon --> unfortunately, I have no idea how to get that data with regex
    }

toponyms = {}
```

##Step 3:

Looping through the two dictionaries and matching, creating a new file: toponyms.csv

```
for i in python_dictionary1:    #looping through python_dictionary1 & checking if placenames/keys match
    if i == key in python_dictionary2:
        toponyms.append(key)    #if they match, append them to the new toponyms dictionary; as the keys in python_dictionary2 should have the placename, lat, lon and the frequency as value, those values shuld then be the values of the keys in the toponyms-dictionary
    else:
        print("No match!")

with open(target_folder+"toponyms.csv", "w", encoding="utf8") as f9: #creating a toponyms.csv-file 
    f9.write("\n".join(toponyms))
```

## Code alltogether:

```
import os, re

source_folder = "C:\\Users\\Tobias\\Desktop\\UNI\\_MA Geschichte\\Zweites Semester\\KU Digital Humanities\\wgetfolder\\Articles3\\"
target_folder = "C:\\Users\\Tobias\\Desktop\\UNI\\_MA Geschichte\\Zweites Semester\\KU Digital Humanities\\_Aufgaben\\PlaceNames\\"
path_to_geonames = "C:\\Users\\Tobias\\Desktop\\UNI\\_MA Geschichte\\Zweites Semester\\KU Digital Humanities\\_Aufgaben\\PlaceNames\\US\\"

list_of_files = os.listdir(source_folder)


dicFreq = {}
list_of_places = []
resultsCSV = []


for f in list_of_files:     #looping through the files from the 'Dispatch'
    with open(source_folder + f, "r", encoding="utf8") as f1:
        placename = re.findall(r'<placeName reg=".*" key=".*" authname=".*">', f) #finding the placenames
        if "tgn,[0-9]+" in placename:
            reg = re.search(r'reg="[A-Z]+"', f).group(1)    #getting the placenames
            key = re.search(r'key="tgn,[0-9]+"', f).group(1) #getting the tgn

            placename = "%09d\t%s" % (reg, key) #appending placenames and tgn to a variable "placename"

            
        list_of_places.append(placename) #appending the placenames to a list


def places_frequency(list_of_places):   #defining a function to create a dictionary that counts the frequency of the placenames
    placefreq = [list_of_places.count(p) for p in list_of_places]
    return dict(zip(list_of_places, placefreq))


dicfreq = places_frequency #storing the function into a variable

        

for key, value in dicfreq.items():  #creating a csv-file for the frequency of the placenames as described on the course-website
    if value > 1:
        newVal = "%09d\t%s" % (value, key)
        resultsCSV.append(newVal)

resultsCSV = sorted(resultsCSV, reverse=True)
print(len(resultsCSV))
resultsToSave = "\n".join(resultsCSV) 

with open(target_folder+"results.csv", "w", encoding="utf8") as f9: #creating a csv-file for the frequency of the placenames as described on the course-website
    f9.write("\n".join(resultsCSV))

with open(target_folder+"placenames.csv", "w", encoding="utf8") as f9:      #creating csv-file for the placenames
    f9.write("\n".join(list_of_places))



python_dictionary1 = {                  #creating the python_dictionary1 where keys are placenames and values 
    (list_of_places, list_of_places
    }

python_dictionary2 = {          #?????? get placename, lat, lon --> unfortunately, I have no idea how to get that data with regex
    }

toponyms = {}

for i in python_dictionary1:    #looping through python_dictionary1 & checking if placenames/keys match
    if i == key in python_dictionary2:
        toponyms.append(key)    #if they match, append them to the new toponyms dictionary; as the keys in python_dictionary2 should have the placename, lat, lon and the frequency as value, those values shuld then be the values of the keys in the toponyms-dictionary
    else:
        print("No match!")

with open(target_folder+"toponyms.csv", "w", encoding="utf8") as f9: #creating a toponyms.csv-file 
    f9.write("\n".join(toponyms))
